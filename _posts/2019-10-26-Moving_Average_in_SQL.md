### Moving Average  
```sql
SELECT
  o.OrderNumber, o.CustomerID, o.OrderTotal,
  SUM(o.OrderTotal) OVER (
    PARTITION BY o.CustomerID
    ORDER BY o.OrderNumber, o.CustomerID
    RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS TotalByCustomer,
  SUM(o.OrderTotal) OVER (
    PARTITION BY o.CustomerID
    /* RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING */
    ) AS TotalOverall,
  SUM(o.OrderTotal) OVER (
    PARTITION BY o.CustomerID
     RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS TotalOverall2
FROM Orders o
ORDER BY o.CustomerID, o.OrderNumber
LIMIT 10
```
